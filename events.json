Before Pokémon GO Tour: Kalos – Global begins on February 28, 2026, you’re invited to this week-long “rewind” of previous GO Tour events, which celebrate the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Unova regions! Plus, early readings are showing that certain Legendary Pokémon, previously featured at each GO Tour event, are getting ready to reappear… Could this be the work of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa? Trainers attending the in-person Pokémon GO Tour: Kalos events in Tainan and Los Angeles can jump into the Kalos-inspired fun even sooner! Check out the event site for more details on how to attend. Pokémon GO Tour: Kalos – Global is a free event available to all Trainers on Saturday, February 28, and Sunday, March 1, 2026, from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time.
